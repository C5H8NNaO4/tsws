# Primitive Types

Let's start by reviewing the most basic and common types you might encounter when writing JavaScript or TypeScript code.
These will later form the core building blocks of more complex types.

### The void, null, and undefined types

JavaScript and TypeScript have two primitive values used to signal absent or uninitialized value: `null` and `undefined`.

These types are most useful in the context of functions, so we'll discuss them in more detail in a later module.
