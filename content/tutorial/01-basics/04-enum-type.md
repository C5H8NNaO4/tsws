# Enum Type

A helpful addition to the standard set of datatypes from JavaScript is the enumeration type, or `enum`.

Enumerations offer an easy way to work with sets of related constants.

> An enum, is a symbolic name for a set of values.

Enumerations are treated as data types, and you can use them to create sets of constants for use with variables and properties.

Whenever a procedure accepts a limited set of variables, consider using an enumeration.

Enumerations make for clearer and more readable code, particularly when meaningful names are used.

Using enumerations:

- Helps reduce errors caused by transposing or mistyping numbers.
- Makes it easy to change values in the future.
- Makes code easier to read, which means it is less likely that errors will creep into it.
- Ensures forward compatibility.

> With enumerations, your code is less likely to fail if in the future someone changes the values corresponding to the member names.
