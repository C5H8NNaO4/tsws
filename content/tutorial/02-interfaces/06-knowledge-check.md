# Knowledge Check

Choose the best response for each of the questions.

```quiz
1. What is the primary job of an interface?

- Define the implementation details for an object.
+ Describe the properties and return types of an object.
- Fulfill the code contract for an object.

2. How can you prevent the type system from raising an error when a property in an interface is omitted?

+ Make the property optional.
- Make the property required.
- Make the property read only.

3. What happens when you extend one interface with another interface?

- Multiple interfaces can have the same property if the property has the exact same name.
- If two interfaces have a property with the same name but different types, TypeScript ignores the property completely.
+ You must implement all the required properties from all interfaces.
