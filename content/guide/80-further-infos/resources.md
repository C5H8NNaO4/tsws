# Learning Resources

If you want to learn more about TypeScript, here are a few other resources that you should check out:

[TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) + [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) 
The official documentation features great guides for beginner TypeScripters, including guides for those switching from other programming languages.

[TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript). This **free** web resource **has everything** you need to start off with TypeScript, including more detailed explanations of the sections we’ve already covered here. I stole some content there.

[Learn TypeScript From Scratch!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwuLxPH8IDs) A practical 3-hour course that goes through all the basic functions of TypeScript, how to use it to interact with some JS frameworks, and how to use the power of TypeScript while writing JavaScript.

[Exercism](https://exercism.org). This is the best resource to practice writing code in a new programming language. Mentors that will steer you towards idiomatic code, lots of fun practice tasks – there is nothing not to love about this website.
